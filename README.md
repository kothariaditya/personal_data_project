Personal Data Project

You can see the file chrome_frequency.py is present in this repository. It was used to analyze my Google Chrome history. 

The file BrowserHistory.json contains my browser history in a json format. 

The folder Takeout_Analysis contains csv files with my daily Google Fit behavioural data. It also contains file analyzing_weekly.py which was used to parse all those csv files.

Post parsing the json & csv files, I extracted the data in a format suitable for d3js.org visualizations. They can be viewed on my website at https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~askothar/.
